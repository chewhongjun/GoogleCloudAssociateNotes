I have been extremely lucky to be part of Google Cloud Sprint 2020, singapore.
This repo will house the notes i'll be taking as part of this program

The cloud Sprint is a 12 Week Program which aims to equipt students with cloud computing skillsets. The program has 2 main resources which is free as of May 2020, which are [Qwiklab](https://www.qwiklabs.com/) and [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/gcp-fundamentals/home/welcome)

*Introduction Lecture:*

The given Project name may not unique but project name is  
[GCP dashboard](https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard)  

*Billing Account & Project*

For each project you create, there must be a billing account attached to it and this billing account can be different for different projects in the google account

- Each project has to be binded to a billing account!
- Conversely you can choose a particular account for a project

*Creating a Virtual Machine (VM)*

- think of a vm like a mini computer with its own memory space and kernal(Operating System)
- in reality a single computer/server can spin up many of these virtual machines
- _To Spin up a vm in GCP_  
	- Google Compute Enginer, GCE (Right handside of the dashboard)
	- This process can take awhile
	- you can now specifcy the specs of this vm instance
	- which includes disk image
	- Region < Zone 

*Interesting Resources*
[Codelabs](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/)
- Which is a practical learning site for learning to use gcp
